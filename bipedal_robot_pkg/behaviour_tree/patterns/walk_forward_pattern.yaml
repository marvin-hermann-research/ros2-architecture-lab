# Walking Forward Motion Pattern
#
# This pattern describes a basic cyclic walking motion for a bipedal robot.
# The sequence models alternating forward stepping with minimal complexity,
# serving as a foundation for more advanced locomotion control.
#
# Each entry specifies a timestamp (in seconds) and the joint angles
# (in degrees) for the hip and knee of both legs.
#
# Angles are relative to the neutral, upright standing position.
#
# The sequence is designed to loop continuously.

walk_forward:
  # Initial phase: Left leg slightly lifted forward, right leg stable
  - time: 0.0
    joints:
      hip_left: 20      # Left hip lifts forward
      knee_left: 45     # Left knee bent for stepping
      hip_right: 0      # Right leg remains stable
      knee_right: 10    # Slight bend in right knee for stability

  # Transition phase: Left leg lowering, right leg begins stepping
  - time: 0.5

  # Mid-stance phase: Left leg behind, right leg forward
  - time: 1.0

      knee_left: 10

  # Preparing next step: Left leg remains back, right leg returns
  - time: 1.5
